Create a project named MicrosoftOffice. Create two classes named Word and PowerPoint. Both classes will have a void method called Open() which takes a String as parameter.



Create two custom exception classes: 1) NameNotApplicableException 2) NameNotValidException

Both classes should override the constructor that takes a String parameter.



Word can only open .doc/.docx files. It prints “Microsoft Word has opened FileName” when it is passed a file to open. Here FileName is the name of the file passed to the method of Word as a String. 

If any other file except the ones it supports (.doc/.docx) is passed to the method, then it will throw NameNotApplicableException.



PowerPoint can only open .ppt/.pps files. It prints “Microsoft PowerPoint has opened FileName” when it is passed a file to open. Here FileName is the name of the file passed to the method of PowerPoint as a String. 

If any other file except the ones it supports (.ppt/.pps) is passed to the method, then it will throw NameNotValidException.



Demonstrate the functionalities in the main function. In the main function, develop objects of both Word and PowerPoint and call the method Open() from both objects using a file name with extensions for each of the objects (You can pass these Strings: Online8.doc, Online8.ppt, Online8.xlsx, Online8.png)






You can use the String method called endsWith() to check the extensions

For example: 

if(str.endsWith(".png")) {
	System.out.println("The filename ends with .png");
}
